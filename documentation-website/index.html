      JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
      is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
      example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
      its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
      Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
      control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
      for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects

      JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
      different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
      does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
      JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
      basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
      from LiveScript to JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
      declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
      number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
      JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
      common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
      dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
      individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
      special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
      objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
      your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
    </p>
    <div class="code"><code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
      greetMe("World");</code></div>

    <ul>
      <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
      <li>
        null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
        case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other
        variant.
      </li>
      <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
